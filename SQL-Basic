Protocols − In SQL Server we have 4 protocols.
- Shared memory (for local connections and troubleshooting purpose).
- Named pipes (for connections which are in LAN connectivity).
- TCP/IP (for connections which are in WAN connectivity).
- VIA-Virtual Interface Adapter (requires special hardware to set up by vendor and also deprecated from SQL 2012 version).
