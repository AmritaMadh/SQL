A view is a named/ stored sql query, stored in the database catalog that allows you to refer to it later.
By definition, views do not store data except for indexed views.
A view may consist of columns from multiple tables using joins or just a subset of columns of a single table. This makes views useful for abstracting or hiding complex queries.

Advantages of views
Generally speaking, views provide the following advantages:

Security:
You can restrict users to access directly to a table and allow them to access a subset of data via views.
For example, you can allow users to access customer name, phone, email via a view but restrict them to access the bank account and other sensitive information.

Simplicity:
A relational database may have many tables with complex relationships e.g., one-to-one and one-to-many that make it difficult to navigate.
However, you can simplify the complex queries with joins and conditions using a set of views.

Consistency:
Sometimes, you need to write a complex formula or logic in every query.
To make it consistent, you can hide the complex queries logic and calculations in views.
Once views are defined, you can reference the logic from the views rather than rewriting it in separate queries.

Unlike regular views, indexed views are materialized views that stores data physically like a table hence may provide some the performance benefit if they are used appropriately.
